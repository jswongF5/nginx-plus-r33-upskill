## F5 Distributed Cloud Tenant Access

Once you join the UDF session, your UDF deployment will start and create an ephemeral account on the F5 Distributed
Cloud console (this may take 5-10min).

1. Once your ephemeral account is created, you will receive an email to set or update your password. Click the
**Update Password** link in the email. Check the spam folder for the account used to register with UDF if you can't
find the email.

1. F5 XC console "persona" and the "skill level" settings dictate how services and configuration options are presented
to the user. These settings are currently not applicable to the NGINX One console. Make any valid selection for each
dialog. Click **Next** or **Get Started** depending on the dialog.

1. Several **Guidance ToolTips** might appear. These are used to inform users of new features when the F5 XC console is
updated. Close the dialogues and continue.

## Accessing NGINX One Console

Once logged into the F5 XC console, the "home" screen shows you various tiles which represent console features. For
example, you might configure Multicloud networking from the "Multi-Cloud Network Connect" tile, build global server load
balancing rules from the "DNS Management" tile, or view synthetic monitoring data from the "Observability" tile. In this
lab, we'll focus on the Nginx One console.

> :point_right: **Note:** Your permissions in the F5 XC console are specific to this lab. You don't have permissions to
all the tiles on the "home" screen.

1. Click the **NGINX One** tile from the home screen.

1. The NGINX One Dashboard shows an overview of your environment, including availability, platform and version
distribution, and CVEs/configuration recommendations. Your dashboard will vary depending on what is installed in your
tenant. Feel free to click around and explore.
